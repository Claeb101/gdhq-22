    //add cases in the camera and world space ui scripts for when the car flips over so that it doesn't look as glitchy
    //finish world generation algorithms
    //finish assets
        //sound

    //create a clear win condition as well as game over screen
    //finish menu stuff



    //OPTIMIZATIONS

    //have the procedurally generated algorithm first mark down where all the roads should be and then, later, go through all the tiles in the dict and instantiate them instead of instantiating and then destroying a bunch of tiles
